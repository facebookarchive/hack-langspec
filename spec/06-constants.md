# Constants

## General

A *constant* is a [named](09-lexical-structure.md#names) value. Once defined, the value
of the constant can not be changed.

A constant can be defined in one of two ways: as a *c-constant* using a [*const-declaration*](16-classes.md#constants) or via a [string literal](09-lexical-structure.md#string-literals), or as a *d-constant* by calling the library function [`define`](http://www.php.net/define). However, the two approaches differ slightly. Specifically:

-   The name of a c-constant must comply with the lexical grammar for a
    name while that for a d-constant can contain any source character.
-   The name of a c-constant is case-insensitive while that for a
    d-constant can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive based on the
    value of the third argument passed to `define`.
-   If `define` is able to define the given name, it returns `true`;
    otherwise, it returns `false`.

The library function [`defined`](http://www.php.net/defined) reports if a given name (specified as a string) is defined as a constant. The library function [`constant`](http://www.php.net/constant) returns the value of a given constant whose name is specified as a string.

**Examples**

```Hack
class C {
  const float MAX_HEIGHT = 10.5;            // define two (case-insensitive) c-constants
  const float UPPER_LIMIT = MAX_HEIGHT;
}
define('COEFFICIENT_1', 2.345, true); // define a case-insensitive d-constant
define('FAILURE', true, false);       // define a case-sensitive d-constant
```

## Context-Dependent Constants

The following constants—sometimes referred to as *magic constants*—are
automatically available to all scripts; their values are not fixed:

 Constant Name                    | Description                     
 -----------------                | ---------                            
 `__CLASS__`                        | `string`; The name of the current class. From within a trait method, the name of the class in which that trait is used. If the current namespace is other than the default, the namespace name and "\\" are prepended, in that order. If used outside all classes, the value is the empty string. 
`__DIR__`                            | `string`; The directory name of the script. A directory separator is only appended for the root directory.
`__FILE__`                           | `string`; The full name of the script.
`__FUNCTION__`                       | `string`; Inside a function, the name of the current function exactly as it was declared, with the following prepended: If a named namespace exists, that namespace name followed by "\". If used outside all functions, the result is the empty string. For a method, no parent-class prefix is present. (See `__METHOD__` and [anonymous functions](15-functions.md#anonymous-functions).)
`__LINE__`                           | `int`; the number of the current source line
`__METHOD__`                         | `string`; Inside a method, the name of the current method exactly as it was declared, with the following prepended, in order: If a named namespace exists, that namespace name followed by "\"; the parent class name or trait name followed by `::`. If used outside all methods, the result is the same as for `__FUNCTION__`.
`__NAMESPACE__`                      | `string`; The name of the current namespace exactly as it was declared. For the default namespace, the result is the empty string.
`__TRAIT__`                          | `string`; The name of the current trait. From within a trait method, the name of the current trait. If used outside all traits, the result is the empty string.

Constant names beginning with __ are reserved for future use by the Engine.

## Core Predefined Constants

The following constants are automatically available to all scripts:

Constant Name | Description
-------------   | -----------  
`E_ALL` | `int`; All errors and warnings, as supported.
`E_COMPILE_ERROR` | `int`; Fatal compile-time errors. This is like an `E_ERROR`, except that `E_COMPILE_ERROR` is generated by the scripting engine.
`E_COMPILE_WARNING` | `int`; Compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors). This is like an `E_WARNING`, except that `E_COMPILE_WARNING` is generated by the scripting engine.
`E_CORE_ERROR` | `int`; Fatal errors that occur during Hack's initial start-up. This is like an `E_ERROR`, except that `E_CORE_ERROR` is generated by the core of Hack.
`E_CORE_WARNING` | `int`; Warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during Hack's initial start-up. This is like an `E_WARNING`, except that `E_CORE_WARNING` is generated by the core of Hack.
`E_DEPRECATED` | `int`; Deprecation notices. Enable this to receive warnings about code that will not work in future versions.
`E_ERROR` | `int`; Fatal run-time errors. These indicate errors that cannot be recovered from, such as a memory allocation problem. Execution of the script is halted.
`E_NOTICE` | `int`; Run-time notices. Indicate that the script encountered something that could indicate an error, but could also happen in the normal course of running a script.
`E_PARSE` | `int`; Compile-time parse errors.
`E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR` | `int`; Catchable fatal error. It indicates that a probably dangerous error occurred, but did not leave the Engine in an unstable state. If the error is not caught by a user defined handler (see the library function [`set_error_handler`](http://www.php.net/set_error_handler)), the application aborts as it was an `E_ERROR`.
`E_STRICT` | `int`; Have Hack suggest changes to the source code to ensure the best interoperability.
`E_USER_DEPRECATED` | `int`; User-generated error message. This is like an `E_DEPRECATED`, except that `E_USER_DEPRECATED` is generated in Hack code by using the library function [`trigger_error`](http://www.php.net/trigger_error).
`E_USER_ERROR` | `int`; User-generated error message. This is like an `E_ERROR`, except that `E_USER_ERROR` is generated in Hack code by using the library function [`trigger_error`](http://www.php.net/trigger_error).
`E_USER_NOTICE` | `int`; User-generated warning message. This is like an `E_NOTICE`, except that `E_USER_NOTICE` is generated in Hack code by using the library function [`trigger_error`](http://www.php.net/trigger_error).
`E_USER_WARNING` | `int`; User-generated warning message. This is like an `E_WARNING`, except that  `E_USER_WARNING` is generated in Hack code by using the library function [`trigger_error`](http://www.php.net/trigger_error).
`E_WARNING` | `int`; Run-time warnings (non-fatal errors). Execution of the script is not halted.
`E_USER_DEPRECATED` | `int`; User-generated warning message. This is like an `E_DEPRECATED`, except that  `E_USER_DEPRECATED` is generated in Hack code by using the library function [`trigger_error`](http://www.php.net/trigger_error).
`INF` | `float`; Infinity
`M_E` | `float`; e
`M_PI` | `float`; Pi
`NAN` | `float`; Not-a-Number
`PHP_EOL` | `string`; the end-of-line terminator for this platform.
`PHP_INT_MAX` | `int`; the maximum representable value for an integer.
`PHP_INT_MIN` | `int`; the minimum representable value for an integer. 
`PHP_INT_SIZE` | `int`; the number of bytes used to represent an integer.

The members of the `E_*` family have values that are powers of 2, so
they can be combined meaningfully using bitwise operators.

## User-Defined Constants

A constant may be defined inside a [class](16-classes.md#constants) or inside an [interface](17-interfaces.md#constants).
